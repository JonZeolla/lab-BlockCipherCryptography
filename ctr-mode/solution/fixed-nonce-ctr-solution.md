XORing this keystream ...

`[72, 200, 236, 241, 160, 67, 177, 156, 4, 223, 62, 132, 51, 104, 195, 163, 61, 242, 173, 251, 77, 182, 80, 140, 40, 35, 12, 98, 189, 253, 21, 75, 146]`

... with each of the ciphertexts, will yield these plaintexts:

```
Fighters can be placed into
two main categories:
the mechanical fighter and
the intellectual fighter.
It's easy for the mechanical
fighter to give advice because
their fighting techniques and
tactics are the result of the
mechanical repetition of strokes,
bred of a lesson which was purely
automatic and lacking an
intelligent explanation of the
'why', the 'how', and the 'when'.
Their fighting follows a similar
pattern in each successive
encounter. The intelligent
fighter will never hesitate to
change tactics in order to use
the correct strokes to deal with
their opponent. It must be plain
by now that the fighter's decision
to use any particular stroke must
be influenced by their opponent's
technique and method of fighting.
```

To verify this in Python 3, given some `line_of_ciphertext`
(keep in mind that this is solvable with nothing more than the XOR operation, albeit much more slowly):
```
line_of_ciphertext = some_list_of_strs_from_the_ciphertexts_file

# strs to ints
ciphertext_bytes = str_list_to_int_list(line_of_ciphertext)

# XOR to recover plaintext
decoded_bytes = xor_lists(keystream, ciphertext_bytes)

# make a list of each character from its byte value,
# then make a single string
decoded_str = ''.join([chr(b) for b in decoded_bytes])

print(decoded_str)
# if you're stuck with Python 2, do this instead:
# print decoded_str
