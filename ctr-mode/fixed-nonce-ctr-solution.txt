Fighters can be placed into
two main categories:
the mechanical fighter and
the intellectual fighter.
It's easy for the mechanical
fighter to give advice because
their fighting techniques and
tactics are the result of the
mechanical repetition of strokes,
bred of a lesson which was purely
automatic and lacking an
intelligent explanation of the
'why', the 'how', and the 'when'.
Their fighting follows a similar
pattern in each successive
encounter. The intelligent
fighter will never hesitate to
change tactics in order to use
the correct strokes to deal with
their opponent. It must be plain
by now that the fighter's decision
to use any particular stroke must
be influenced by their opponent's
technique and method of fighting.
