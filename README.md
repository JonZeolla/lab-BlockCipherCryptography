An introductory lab to cryptographic block cipher modes.

## How to clone this branch
* `git clone https://github.com/JonZeolla/lab-BlockCipherCryptography`
  * Clone the latest revision of the lab-BlockCipherCryptography repo.
* `git clone -b 2018-02-08_SCIS_BlockCipherCryptography https://github.com/JonZeolla/lab-BlockCipherCryptography`
  * This will only work after 2018-02-08.  It will clone the revision of the lab-BlockCipherCryptographyrepo used during the 2018-02-08 Steel City InfoSec lab.  Cloning any of the pointers (tags) will put you in a detached HEAD state, which is expected.
