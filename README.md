# Block Cipher Cryptography Lab
An introductory lab to cryptographic block cipher modes.

## How to use this repo
This repo has multiple labs, each of which are self-contained in their own folders.  Simply navigate into one of the folders and start by looking at the README.md.

**Important Note**:  There are hints and solutions in each of the lab's `README.md` but they are hidden when rendered by github.com.  We suggest that you use github to view any `.md` files in order to get the intended experience.

## How to clone this branch
* `git clone https://github.com/JonZeolla/lab-BlockCipherCryptography`
  * Clone the latest revision of the lab-BlockCipherCryptography repo.
* `git clone -b 2018-02-08_SCIS_BlockCipherCryptography https://github.com/JonZeolla/lab-BlockCipherCryptography`
  * This will only work after 2018-02-08.  It will clone the revision of the lab-BlockCipherCryptographyrepo used during the 2018-02-08 Steel City InfoSec lab.  Cloning any of the pointers (tags) will put you in a detached HEAD state, which is expected.
